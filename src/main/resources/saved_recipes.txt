1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

1 and 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 good pie crust, chilled or frozen

Preheat the oven to 425°F.
Make the filling: Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices-cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
Pour into pie shell and bake: Pour the filling into an uncooked pie shell. Bake for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 40 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
About half-way through baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.
Cool on a rack: Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours. Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up and will deflate as it cools. Serve with whipped cream.
